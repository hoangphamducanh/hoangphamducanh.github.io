<p><b><h3>Opening</h3></b></p>
<p><h6>There are many fascinating developments in the IT world. 
  Some succeed and are likely to change the way the world looks, and some historical 
  examples of such developments include the Internet, smartphones, cloud computing, 
  and public-key cryptography</h6></p>

<p><h6>In the previous section, I have described why I chose this project idea, 
  why it is attractive and has a significant impact on people around me. 
  In this section, I will discuss further what technologies it used as well as some 
  technologies that are relevant to my project.</h6></p>

<p><h6>What is Cloud-computing and (SaaS) & What does it do?</h6></p>

<p><h6>As I mention above, Cloud-computing is one of the world-changing factors, plus it also plays a 
  vital role in developing an application. "Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, 
  on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) 
  that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of 
  five essential characteristics (On-demand self-service, Broad network access., Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity, Measured service), 
  few service models such as: "Platform as a Service (PaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)) and four deployment models 
  (Private cloud, Community cloud, Public cloud, Hybrid cloud)." (Peter Mell (NIST), Tim Grance (NIST), 2011)</h6></p>

<p><b><h3>Cloud Computing - Software as a service (SaaS)</h3></b></p>
<p><h6>Asides from PaaS, IaaS that I mention above. Which service did building an application need? It is "SaaS" or Software as a service.!</h6></p>
<p><h6>What is SaaS or Software as a service? “Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. 
  Typical examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365). SaaS provides a complete software solution that you 
  purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organization, and your users connect to 
  it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software, and app data are located 
  in the service provider’s data center. The service provider manages the hardware and software, and with the appropriate service agreement, 
  it will ensure the availability and the security of the app and your data. SaaS allows your organization to get quickly up and running with
  an app at minimal upfront cost”. (Azure, n.d.). Some come SaaS scenarios that we all know but did not notice it. If you have used a web-based 
  email service such as Outlook, Hotmail, or Yahoo! Mail, then you have already used a form of SaaS. With these services, you log into your account 
  over the Internet, often from a web browser. The email software is located on the service provider’s network, and your messages are stored there as well. 
  You can access your email and stored messages from a web browser on any computer or Internet-connected device. The previous examples are free services for personal use. 
  For organizational use, you can rent productivity apps, such as email, collaboration, calendaring, and sophisticated business applications such as customer relationship management (CRM), 
  enterprise resource planning (ERP), and document management. You pay for the use of these apps by subscription or according to the level of use.</h6></p>

  <p><b><h3>Advantages of SaaS</h3></b></p>
  <p><h6>There are several advantages to using SaaS, which could be listed as so:</h6></p>

  <p><b><h3>Gain access to sophisticated applications</h3></b></p>
  <p><h6>To provide SaaS apps to users, you do not need to purchase, install, update, or maintain hardware, middleware, or software. 
  SaaS makes even sophisticated enterprise applications, such as ERP and CRM, affordable for organizations that lack the resources to buy, deploy,
  and manage the required infrastructure and software themselves. (Azure, n.d.)</h6></p>

  <p><b><h3>Pay only for what you use</h3></b></p>
  <p><h6>SaaS can provide beneficial cost savings since it usually resides in a shared or multi-tenant environment, where the hardware and software license costs are low compared with the traditional model. (IBM Team, IBM Cloud, 2020)</h6></p>
  <p><h6>Another advantage is that you can rapidly scale your customer base since SaaS allows small and medium businesses to use software that they would not use otherwise due to the high licensing cost. (Azure, n.d.)</h6></p>
  <p><h6>Maintenance costs are reduced since the SaaS provider owns the environment, and it is split among all customers that use that solution. (Azure, n.d.)</h6></p>

  <p><b><h3>Use free client software</h3></b></p>
  <p><h6>Users can run most SaaS apps directly from their web browser without downloading and installing any software, although some apps require plugins. 
  Free client software means that you do not need to purchase and install special software for your users. (Azure, n.d.)</h6></p>

  <p><b><h3>Mobilize your workforce efficiently</h3></b></p>
  <p><h6>SaaS makes it easy to “mobilize” your workforce because users can access SaaS apps and data from any Internet-connected computer or mobile device. 
  You do not need to worry about developing apps to run on different computers and devices because the service provider has already done so. 
  Besides, you do not need to bring unique expertise onboard to manage mobile computing's security issues. A carefully chosen service provider 
  will ensure the security of your data, regardless of the type of device consuming it. (Azure, n.d.)</h6></p>

  <p><b><h3>Access app data from anywhere</h3></b></p>
  <p><h6>With data stored in the cloud, users can access their information from any Internet-connected computer or mobile device.
  Moreover, when app data is stored in the cloud, no data is lost if a user’s computer or device fails. (Azure, n.d.)</h6></p>
