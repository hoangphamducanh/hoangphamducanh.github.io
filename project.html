        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
          <p><b><h3>Overview</h3></b></p>
          <p><h6>My project will be about a phone application that helps people focus and blocks out all other distractions. 
            Some might confuse with web blockers apps, but this is a different one. This app will allow you to block websites 
            and applications (determined by the user) to block out all notifications from social media and websites that they 
            do not want to get notifications from. This application will also allow you to set schedule and timer for each of 
            your studying and working period. This application is nothing but the encouragement for you to focus on your studying 
            and working more than surfing the internet and getting distracted by other features.</h6></p>

          <p><b><h3>Motivation</h3></b></p>
          <p><h6>There are plenty of apps that cost distraction in the modern world, and a common distraction 
            that has only recently evolved would be social media and the internet such as Facebook, Reddit, 
            Instagram, Titok, and other social media applications that could also cause a distraction. 
            Surfing the internet and social media is becoming more popular for students, seniors, and even workers. 
            Therefore, this is my biggest motivation to create an application that will help students, college, and 
            workers block out all the distractions they get from their phones. Furthermore, this will create a workflow 
            and make things much more comfortable, easier, and faster than getting distracted by your phone notification every minute.</h6></p>

          <p><b><h3>Description</h3></b></p>
          <p><h6>There are three main features that I am going to focus on while developing this app.</h6></p>
          <p><h6>First of all, the application is free, and everyone can download and enjoy it. People enjoy using 
            the free application, but they will not hesitate to pay for its quality. However, a successful application 
            will take tons of time to develop, fixing bugs, contents, and PR marketing of the app and be successful and 
            known by the users. Therefore, free application is one of my priorities. Whenever users like, they can purchase 
            premium to better view the app, and some changes feature such as themes, decoration, upgrade statistics, and more.</h6></p>

          <p><h6>Secondly, it is simple and easy to use user interface. A successful company will know how to optimize their 
            UI and make it as simple and easy to use. No one likes complicated things, and the world is going on a minimalism 
            trend when everything is as most straightforward as possible. My application's UI will have only five buttons, one 
            in the middle, which displays one big circle with the word "Sleep," meaning to put the phone into sleep mode. It will 
            automatically block all the notifications from an application such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, Reddit, and other 
            social media applications except for learning or productivity application such as Mail, Outlook, Dictionary. Other 
            buttons will include: "setting, dark/light mode, and statistic." The statistic will display how much time you have not 
            been using your phone. The setting will include: "account, updates, times & languages, privacy, personalization, and more. 
            To be more specific about the statistic part. It will not only show you how much time you have not been using your phone. 
            When upgrading the app to premium, it also rewards you if you reach the amount of "1 day, 10days, 20 days, one month, a year 
            and more level of achievements. The reward will be an "in application" gold coin, which you can use to buy a new application 
            theme such as: "Christmas, Summer, Tet, and other festivals during the year as well."</h6></p>

          <p><h6>Furthermore, you can also use gold coins to buy some of the characters related to the theme. 
            For example: "Santa Claus, reindeers, the grinch, elf and Christmas tree for Christmas theme, 
            " Chung cake, fireworks, peach flowers, apricot flowers, golden fish, a red envelope, and the 
            symbolic animal represent that year." Aside from changing the application's theme, it will also 
            allow you to customize the avatar frame and customize the application UI.</h6></p>

          <p><h6>Lastly, it definitely has to be building a communication channels with app users. 
            “Research indicates that only 42% of users will respond to notifications. Hence, there is a necessity 
            to build different communication channels with users. Some solutions are in-app messaging and an 
            in-app message center. Ideally, the app should include both from the beginning. A message center is an inbox within 
            the app that allows for engagement with users. Similarly, in-app messaging allows users to send messages 
            to others who are active in the app.” (Lastovetska, 2020) [5] Therefore, it is essential to know what your customers think and support them 24/7 whenever they need it.</h6></p>

          <p><b><h3>Tools and Techonologies</h3></b></p>
          <p><h6>Nowadays, we can use numerous tools and technologies to create a phone application, but not 
            all are easy to use or work across multi-platform. For those reasons, we need to select the tools 
            very carefully to manage in succeeding with the project. The list below will contain various options 
            to choose from and a multi-platform and single platform tools.
          <p><h6>First on the list is XCode, an ideal program if you use the macOS operating system. “XCode introduces 
            a new way to design and build software. Live rendering within Interface Builder displays your hand-written 
            UI code within the design canvas, instantly reflecting changes you type in code. XCode provides developers 
            a unified workflow for user interface design, coding, testing, and debugging”. (Haije, 2019) [6]</h6></p>

          <p><h6>Secondly, we have Android Studio, which is an Android development Software built by Google. 
            “Its implementation editor is handy for Android developers. Android studio provides shortcuts for coding and designing, 
            and its layout designer makes it very easy to use, which helps reduce time spent on coding. Android Studio also provides 
            drag and drop features to design the layout of your projects”. (Haije, 2019) [6]</h6></p>

          <p><h6>Last but not least, we have a cross-platform mobile development tool, which is Ionic. “Ionic is an easy-to-use and 
            easy-to-learn framework that allows for quick prototyping with a decent CLI. Integration with Angular makes for a pleasant 
            environment to code in. Built on standard web technology, Ionic helps teams build and ship beautiful cross-platform hybrid 
            and Progressive Web Apps with ease”. (Haije, 2019) [6]</h6></p>

          <p><h6>All of the tools I mentioned above are free for the starting price. Thou it still has certain disadvantages. However, these tools are recommended by many websites that developers can use to create mobile applications. </h6></p>

          <p><b><h3>Skills required</h3></b></p>
          <p><h6>There are several skills, along with some characteristics and ability required to create a phone application.</h6></p>
          <p><h6>First of all, it is the most important, which is teamwork. Maybe we are not geniuses or talented, but teamwork makes the dreamwork. Considering sitting down together and discuss the problem and do solve it together. It is better than talented people doing works on their own compared to a group of four people.</h6></p> 
          <p><h6>Secondly, one is analytical skills, which help understanding user needs to create an application that they wanted to use.</h6></p> 
          <p><h6>The third one is communication skills to contact the user, ask the right questions, and understand their needs.</h6></p> 
          <p><h6>Problem-solving skills are also required because they help figure out the problem, solve it, improve it, and upgrade the application to make it better.</h6></p>
          <p><h6>Finally, to work on many programming languages such as HTML, Java, C, R, and more.
          <p><h6>Besides all those skills, creativity, logical-thinking, optimism</h6></p>

          <p><b><h3>Outcome</h3></b></p>
          <p><h6>Assuming that this project went well, and my application is functional. There will be a tremendous effect on society in general as well as studying and working in general.</h6></p>
